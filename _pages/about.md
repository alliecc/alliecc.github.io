I am currently a PhD student in Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, under supervision of  Simon Lucey  and Michael Kaess. I am interested in robot vision, especially for 3D reconstruction and efficient real-world deep network applications.
Before CMU, I graduated from National Taiwan University in 2012, worked in Quanta computer and MediaTek as ISP(Image Signal Processor) algorithm developer for 3 years.
